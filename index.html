  <p>This is change made in the "Try-something" branch</p>

  <p>Staging test</p>

  <p>stage test number 2</p>

<h1>this change is so I can add it to staging.</h1>
<h1>This was made after staging. I will now re-add this staging without unstaging and commit. If this shows in the git diff after commiting, it means that re-adding this without unstaging first does not work since it will compare commit to existing. </h1>
