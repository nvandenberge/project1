<!-- Why I Code -->
  <section>
    <h2>Why do I want to learn how to code?</h2>
      <p>I wanted to learn how to code because I wanted to start a career I could really progress in. Coding is something that is constantly evolving. There's always new concepts you can learn. I like being able to imagine a design or application and make it come to life. </p>
